                        <p>New York Fed's AIG Mortgage Assets Might Fetch $15 Billion</p>
                        <p>The  Bank of New York's sales of the mortgage securities it assumed in the 2008 rescue of  would probably fetch $15 billion "at most" at current prices, less than the insurer offered, according to Barclays Capital Inc. analysts.</p>
                        <p>"As such, while it does not have to be the case, a significant slowdown or even a temporary halt in sales till the market recovers should not be ruled out," New York-based analysts at Barclays Capital led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha wrote in a June 10 report.</p>
                        <p>The New York Fed is selling the bonds piecemeal after rejecting a $15.7 billion bid for the securities from New York- based AIG in March. Before AIG's offer for the $31 billion of debt was declined, investment banks including Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley tried to put together groups of investors to offer rival bids for the entire pool, people familiar with the matter said at the time.</p>
                        <p>The central bank's auctions have combined with signs of a weakening U.S. economy and a deepening European sovereign crisis to help roil markets, including those for subprime-mortgage securities and high-yield corporate bonds, as investment banks seek to dump risk on stockpiled debt. Drops last week in commercial-mortgage securities, which were stoked partly by the Fed's auctions, "evoked memories of the 2008 market meltdown," Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a June 10 report.</p>

                    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., the second-largest U.S. bank, ousted mortgage chief David Lowman after it overcharged active-duty military personnel on loans and improperly foreclosed on other borrowers. Bloomberg's Dawn Kopecki reports on Bloomberg Television's "InBusiness With Margaret Brennan." </p>
                        <p>JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), the second- largest U.S. bank, ousted mortgage chief David Lowman after it overcharged active-duty military personnel on loans and improperly foreclosed on other borrowers. "Dave Lowman and I have decided he will leave the firm," Frank Bisignano, the head of home-lending, said today in an internal employee memo obtained by Bloomberg News.</p>
                        <p>JPMorgan has been taking steps this year to repair its mortgage unit, which posted at least $3.3 billion in losses during the first quarter. Lowman, 54, who ran home-lending since leaving Citigroup Inc. (C) in 2006, was directed in February to start reporting to Chief Administrative Officer Bisignano, 51. The New York-based bank then hired Cindy Armine, Citigroup's chief compliance officer, last month to increase oversight as chief control officer of home-lending. "We thank Dave for his five years of service to our firm," Bisignano said in the memo. "He worked here during extraordinary times and has said he will take some much needed time off. </p>
                        <p>All U.S. banks are dealing with the backlash from a bust in housing as mortgage losses and related litigation suppress earnings. Home prices in 20 U.S. cities fell 5.1 percent in the first quarter, the largest decline since the first quarter of 2009, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.</p>
                        <p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, said JPMorgan's record $5.6 billion in profit during the first quarter was tempered by "extraordinarily high losses we still are bearing on mortgage-related issues."</p>
                        <p>"Unfortunately, these losses will continue for a while," Dimon said in a statement on April 13 when the bank reported results. JPMorgan's performance has been hampered by poor performing mortgage portfolios acquired when it bought Washington Mutual Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. in 2008. </p>

                        <p>Apple Inc. on Tuesday began selling "unlocked" versions of its iPhone online.</p>
                        <p>It marks the first time the company has sold the devices without being tied to a wireless provider. The devices are being sold in black or white as a 16 gigabyte version for $649 or a 32 gigabyte version for $749. The iPhones are GSM-compatible, which means they will work with either AT&T or T-Mobile in the U.S., although they won't support T-Mobile's 3G download speeds.</p>
                        <p>Apple, which employs about 1,000 people in Austin, said the unlocked iPhone is aimed at overseas travelers from the U.S.: "If you don't want a multiyear service contract or if you prefer to use a local carrier when traveling abroad, the unlocked iPhone 4 is the best choice. It arrives without a micro-SIM card, so you'll need an active micro-SIM card from any supported GSM carrier worldwide."</p>

                    	<p>Apple to pay Nokia big settlement plus royalties after losing patent case</p>
                        <p>Finnish phone-maker could pursue makers of Google Android phones after victory in long-running legal battle</p>
                        <p>Apple will pay Nokia ongoing royalties on each iPhone sold as part of its settlement in the patent case.</p> 
                        <p>The Finnish phone-maker Nokia could receive a one-off payment of more than €800m (£700m) from Apple and receive further royalties of €8 per iPhone sold in future, after winning a long-running patents case.The company subsequently hinted that it may pursue makers of smartphones using Google's Android mobile operating system, of which 36m were sold in the first quarter of 2011.The settlement signed on Tuesday related to patents for mobile technology that helped Apple to revolutionise the phone industry in 2007 when it launched the first iPhone.Although terms of the settlement were not disclosed, previous patent licensing deals in the phone industry have been worth up to 5% of the price of the device involved. At €8, or $11.50 (£7), they would represent about 4.5% of the estimated average $264 cost price of an iPhone, which Apple sells to retailers and phone networks for an average of $660. Apple has sold 108m iPhones since their launch.Nokia's shares rose by 3% as it said that the one-off payment, whose size was not revealed, will have "a positive financial impact" on its upcoming quarterly results.At the end of May it forecast that its mobile phone division, which for years has been the biggest in the world, would see reduced revenues and might not make a profit for the first time in a decade. The one-off payment should push it back to its usual quarterly profit levels. Ongoing royalties from Apple of about 1% of the average sale price of a handset would be worth about $430m to Nokia this year, analysts estimated.Nokia may now also choose to sue makers of handsets running Google's free Android mobile operating system if it decides that they have also infringed its patents.Nokia's chief executive, Stephen Elop, said: "This settlement ... enables us to focus on further licensing opportunities in the mobile communications market."</p>
                        <p>A spokesman for Apple said: "Apple and Nokia have agreed to drop all of our current lawsuits and enter into a licence covering some of each other's patents, but not the majority of the innovations that make the iPhone unique. We're glad to put this behind us and get back to focusing on our respective businesses."Florian Mueller, an independent specialist and blogger on patent battles, said that "the deal structure – a one-time payment as well as running royalties – suggests a fairly good outcome for Nokia". He added: "Maybe Nokia could have continued to play hardball and got an even better deal if it didn't face the challenges it undoubtedly has. But this looks like a fairly important victory." He suggested that Apple would benefit if Nokia pursues Android handset-makers, because they have smaller margins and would be less easily able to afford royalties. Android dominates the smartphone market with a 36% share, ahead of Nokia's Symbian with 27% and Apple's 17%, according to the research company Gartner.Financial analysts had mixed views on the outcome.</p>
                        <p>Mikael Rautanen, at Inderes in Helsinki, said: "This is the first positive news from Nokia for a long time. They can both focus on their businesses now, and the dispute was settled to Nokia's advantage." But others remained bearish on the group's longer-term prospects. "This [the Apple deal] could cause the stock to have a bit of a relief rally, but does very little to address the stark reality that the company is facing," Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura, said.</p>
                        <p>On Monday, Nomura forecast that Nokia will be passed by both Samsung and Apple in the smartphone market worldwide over the next four months, and that its phone business will shrink by about 20% over the next two years as it tries to shift from Symbian to Microsoft's Windows Phone on smartphones.</p>
                        <p>"We see no reason to remain anything other than negative on the stock," said Windsor.Nokia's shares are still down about 25% since 30 May, representing a €5.5bn fall in market capitalisation for one of Europe's biggest technology companies.</p>
                        <p>The case settled on Tuesday was filed in 2009 by Nokia, which said it had filed a patent 10 years ago that covered the use of touchscreen technology in phones.Ironically, announcing the iPhone in 2007, Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said of the multi-touch screen interface: "Boy, have we patented it!", in a warning to would-be rivals.Elop said: "We are very pleased to have Apple join the growing number of Nokia licensees. This settlement demonstrates Nokia's industry-leading patent portfolio and enables us to focus on further licensing opportunities in the mobile communications market."</p>

Through these Express stores, Walmart aims to compete with the dollar stores that are increasing their footprint in the United States retail market. Walmart also competes with other big-name retailers like Target (TGT), Costco (COST), Amazon (AMZN) and Best Buy (BBY).  Our price estimate for Walmart stands at $74.46, which implies just about 40% upside to the market price.  The Right Road for the No. 1 Retailer  Walmart Express stores will carry everything consumers might need at the spur of the moment, from milk and eggs to DVDs. All locations will have a pharmacy while some will also sell gasoline. All stores offer check-cashing services and accept food stamps. Walmart plans to open about 15 to 20 Walmart Express locations this year, in rural municipalities in northwest Arkansas and North Carolina and also in urban markets in Chicago.  Walmart Express design is sized to fit into cities where space is at a premium, as well as in rural areas that can't support a superstore. The first one was opened in rural Gentry, Ark. Walmart is also experimenting with a prototype for urban markets in Chicago which is expected to open this summer.</p>
                        <p>Dollar Stores Heightening Competition</p>
                        <p>Dollar-store chains have expanded quickly in recent years and pose intense competition to Walmart. They open stores closer to customers' homes, a big advantage in times of high gas prices. According to a Credit Suisse analyst, the average round-trip to a dollar store is six miles vs. 30 miles for a typical Walmart trip. These stores have enjoyed strong revenue growth as they've lured more shoppers with bargain prices and wider selections. We believe Walmart's focus on Walmart Express stores could provide a big boost to its top line growth. This could also help Walmart build on its already established image as the world's largest low-cost retailer and gain an edge in this market segment.</p>

                        <p>Education is the key to sustainable development. This is why the Otto Group is making a financial contribution to a social project established by the Cotton made in Africa initiative to promote adult literacy.</p>
                        <p>This public private partnership project receives major support from the Otto Group and offers some 5,000 adults in the Central-South region the opportunity to learn to read and write in evening school. "Improving the literacy rate is one of the key factors in establishing a sustainable development process," is how Andreas Streubig, Otto Group Division Manager Environmental and Social Policy, explains the company's engagement. </p>
                        <p>The project was established in the autumn of 2009 within the framework of the Cotton made in Africa initiative, together with the fashion company Apart, the German Society for Investment and Development (DEG) and Welthungerhilfe. The illiteracy rate of around 71% has an extraordinary high impact on the economic development of Burkina Faso and also poses very specific challenges for the smallholder farmers who participate in the Cotton made in Africa initiative: many cannot enjoy the potential benefits of the educational courses on offer because they cannot make notes or even read the course materials. Here, the literacy project helps people to help themselves.</p>

                        <p>Silver looks set to outperform gold in the second half of the year as strong investment demand compensates for a slump in industrial demand</p>
                        <p>Silver weakened in the second half of 2011 not only in absolute terms, but also relatively to gold as a result of its more widespread industrial use - but has recovered noticeably since the beginning of the year. The price of silver is currently about 9.5 per cent higher than at the start of 2011. By contrast, gold is slightly lower.</p>
                        <p>A sharp rise in investment demand for silver has largely gone unnoticed. The largest silver exchange-traded fund, iShare, now has a stock of just under 8,300 tonnes. Overall, silver inventories at exchange traded funds total around 10,000 tonnes.</p>
                        <p>The interest in silver coins is remarkable. The high demand for the American Silver Eagle is probably due to it being a more affordable purchase for the general public than its gold counterpart.As a tight market is also being caused by the supply side, because mining production, which accounts for about three-quarters of total silver supply, will at best stagnate and possibly even decline.</p>
                        <p>After a weaker second quarter we expect silver prices to rise to $16 an ounce, from current levels of around $12. We also see more scope for the price to rise than to fall.</p>

                     	<p>PIMCO's El Erian: EU Fumbling Greek Debt Crisis</p>
                        <p>Bailout efforts may be 'wasted' if approach is not changed</p>
                        <p>Mohammed El-Erian, head of PIMCO, the largest bond fund in the world, and a daughter of Allianz SE,  said in a Sunday interview that the European Union (EU) must change its approach to the Greek debt crisis or risk spending billions for nothing.</p>
                        <p>According to Reuters, El-Erian in an interview that appeared Sunday in an Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, said that Europe was risking billions by simply propping up the Greek economy without changing its method. "After a year, every indicator has unfortunately worsened, despite the incredible quantity of financial assistance," he was quoted saying.</p>
                        <p>"All of this has terrible human consequences and it's associated with a transfer of liabilities from private creditors to European taxpayers. Why? Very little is being done to deal with the excess of public debt, and the conditions for higher growth are not being put in place," he said. "Further on, if this approach is kept up, more money will be wasted to save private creditors and the risk of a disorderly restructuring of the debt will be greater."</p>
                        <p>El-Erian's appraisal of the situation comes after an agreement on Friday, as previously reported by AdvisorOne, between France and Germany not to press for private investors to share in losses through so-called voluntary restructuring, in which they would be expected to exchange bonds for new ones with longer maturity dates or to purchase new ones as older ones mature.</p>
